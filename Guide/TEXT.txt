[Pawpaw Pang]

Vegetables, fruits and fish are flying to the cat.
The cat doesn't seem to like vegetables and fruits.
Whenever your cat swallows the fish, you get the score.
If you score 100 hearts, you can meet a new adorable cat.
Let's meet all cats and make a complete
collection of 'Pawpaw Pang Friends'.
